# SpeakMySigns – Real-Time Gesture-to-Speech for Indian Sign Language Users

> _"From signs to sentences, from gestures to voices — SpeakMySigns speaks for you."_

## 📌 Overview
**SpeakMySigns** is a **real-time Gesture-to-Speech** system designed to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.  
Tailored for **Indian Sign Language (ISL)**, it captures sign gestures through a webcam, predicts their meaning, forms complete sentences, and speaks them aloud — enabling smooth conversation between signers and non-signers.

### How It Works
1. **Capture** – Detects both **static** and **dynamic** gestures in real time using a webcam.
2. **Predict** – Classifies gestures with a trained deep learning model.
3. **Compose** – Converts recognized sign sequences into grammatically correct sentences with a fine-tuned **FLAN-T5** model.
4. **Speak** – Uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to vocalize the generated sentences.

## ✨ Features
- 🎥 **Real-Time Gesture Detection** – Works with both static and dynamic signs.
- 🧠 **Sentence Formation** – Turns multiple recognized gestures into structured sentences.
- 🔊 **Voice Output** – Built-in TTS for spoken communication.
- 🖥 **Dual Workflow** – Includes **training pipeline**, **Jupyter notebook experiments**, and **Flask web app**.
- 🌐 **Accessible & Inclusive** – Designed for **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** users.
